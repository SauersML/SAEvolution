"""
This script serves as the main entry point and conductor for the simulation. 
It loads parameters from the configuration file, establishes the initial 
population of agents, controls the primary loop iterating through generations, 
sequences the execution of game rounds and the subsequent evolutionary updates 
for each generation, and oversees overall simulation logging and state saving.

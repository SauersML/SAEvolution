"""
This script serves as the main entry point and orchestrator for the LLM evolution
simulation. It loads simulation parameters from the configuration file, 
initializes the population of agents using `agent_manager`, runs the main loop 
over the specified number of generations, coordinates the execution of game 
rounds (utilizing `game_engine` logic) and the evolutionary step (using 
`agent_manager`) within each generation, and manages high-level logging and 
periodic saving of the simulation state.

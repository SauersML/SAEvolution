"""
This module defines the data structure for an individual agent, encompassing 
its behavioral genome settings and accumulated wealth. It manages the group 
of agents and implements the core evolutionary mechanics: calculating relative 
success scores from wealth, determining which agents reproduce based on these 
scores, and algorithmically modifying the genomes of offspring by automatically 
adjusting features based on a contrastive analysis of the parent's performance 
in recent successful versus unsuccessful interactions.
